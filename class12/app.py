# Line/lines of code that is supposed to do one /multi tasks, but this code when we run it will run in one block.

# if a block of code ends, the next block of code that we start will start from the very beginning of line such that there will be no indentation at all.

# if it is a block of code where you are writing a (:) after the colon everything that you want to include in that block of code will be indented.

# The next block starts from the very beginning of line, no space left at all.
